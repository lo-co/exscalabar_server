## Message Logs

Many actions, errors and warnings will produce a log message.  Each log message has the following format 

<systime> <[location]> <msg> 

where *systime* represents the system generated time, *location* is an indicator of either 1) where the message was generated or 2) if the message is system generated by an action (ERROR or WARNING) and *msg* is the message produced by the system.  The following location tags are used throughout the code:

* ctl
* pas
* crds
* device
