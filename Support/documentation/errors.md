# Error Handling

In all VIs where there is a potential for failure, the ``System Log::Log Message`` is called and the error output of the operation is wired to the error input of the method.  This will allow the system to write errors to the log file.  All logged errors appear with the heading ``[ERROR]``.  When the error is not expected to be catastrophic (as most are not), the error out of the VI which is handling the operation (such as a message ``Do`` method or a command ``Handle Command`` method) is wired to the error out of the ``System Log::Log Message`` method.  This results in a cleared error and normal operation continues.  If the error is intended to cause a change in the larger operations, then the error is passed out.  **When the error is passed out of the ``Do`` method of a message then this will result in the object shutting down!**
