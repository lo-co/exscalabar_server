## Data ##

Data is maintained by the ``Controller`` object in a [data value reference (DVR)](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361L-01/lvconcepts/external_data_val_ref/).  The DVR prevents excessive memory copies (i.e. limits the memory footprint by providing access to a single slice of memory) for an object which can contain a significant amount of data which is used by several objects.

All VIs calimed by the ``Controller`` have access to the DVR directly.  Outside, access to the DVR is controlled via a FGV which provides the data object when necessary rather than the reference.

## The Data Object ##

Data is aggregated within the main data object ``xData`` from various sources.  These include the Alicats, the PPTs, and the Vaisalas as well as the CRDS and the PAS.  In addition, the ``Controller`` object itself is a source of data.  The data generated by the controller is data that is used across the system or that may have no obvious owner.  These include the ozone valves and generator state, the filter state, etc.
