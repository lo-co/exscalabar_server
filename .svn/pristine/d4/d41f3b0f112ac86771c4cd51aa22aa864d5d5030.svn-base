; The following section defines the behavior of pressure calibrations.
; Pressure will run both up and down from Pcurrent-25 to Pmin.
; The pressure will change through Nsteps, evenly divided, and will
; remain at a pressure for a period of twait seconds.

; Flows defind as in specifications, Fig 1.
; Flows go in order - A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H are related to the instrument flows;
; K goes through the purafil scrubber and J is the mirror purge flow.
; There should be 10 flows in all.
