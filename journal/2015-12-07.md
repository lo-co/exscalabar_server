## Interaction with the CVT from the Client Side

In the CVT service, I have a variable called ``first_call``.  The intention of this variable is to ensure that the CVT reloads when the UI is started or changed.  Unfortunately, this is called only at the start of the service.  Since the service is a singleton, this means that the program will call it only one time.  To remedy this, I am going to place the service in all page calls which can change the state of the system.
