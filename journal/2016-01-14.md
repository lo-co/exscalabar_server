Currently trying to fix the issues associated with writing device configuration information.  All device configuration data will be written to the CVT.  I have now appended ``device.`` so that the different values don't write over each other.  The way that the CVT works is that the group only matters if it is a sub-group.  So, if I have two groups labeled ``ID``, then the one that is written to last will be the ``ID`` that is written.  **Not sure how I missed this functionality (I knew it was there).**
