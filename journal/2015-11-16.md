## Documentation

It is important to let the guys on the other side know exactly how they need to approach debugging the system and how exactly they might expect the system to behave (what works and what doesn't).  For instance, all ``Actor Core``s and their corresponding overrides are **reentrant** - this means that either you need to 

1. wrap the code of interest for debugging in something that is not reentrant, or
2. set the method to reentrant

The latter approach has the possibility of introducing uninteded side-effects (such as blocking operations as one core waits for a message).
