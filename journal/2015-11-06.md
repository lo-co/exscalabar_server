## System is Back!!

Finally got the system back up and running.  As it turned out, the problem was related to the file actor (lack of a visible v: drive) and an error that was causing the ``Controller`` to not start properly.  I thought everything was working well, but it looks like one of my references in the ``Controller::Stop Core`` is a) shutdown prematurely OR b) never initialized.  I think that this is likely do to (b). So, I need to 

* investigate this further
* prune the system - free it of the dead weight.
* finally get the ``Calibration Actor`` integrated.
* Add in TEC code - make sure it jives with the code developed at NOAA.
* Fold in humidification control.

Ugh.  That is a lot!
