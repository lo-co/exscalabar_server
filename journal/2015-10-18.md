## Calibration

Still focusing on calibration stuff - looking at TODO's from the 14th.  Along with the ``Start Calibration MSG``, I need to add a ``Stop Calibration MSG``.

Added:

* Code to handle attempts to launch duplicate actors.  This means that the user **will not** be able to launch multiple calibration routines (each calibration carries the same ``ID`` - ``calibration``).
* Member of ``Calibration Actor`` to hold the calibration file path.  This will be written to at the time the calibration is started.

It might be a good idea to change the format of the calibration files.  I think that I may want them to look something like

```xml
<tag type="t">val</tag>
```
