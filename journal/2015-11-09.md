## Calibration

So, the calibration actor is now in place.  The calibrations will have to got through some predefined pre- and post-calibration actions.  

__**Pre**__

* Store cycle states
* Turn off filter cycle
* Turn off speaker cycle

__**Post**__

* Reset the cycle states to the previous states, turning on the filter and speaker cycle as necessary.
* Set O2 flow to 0
* Close O2 valve
* Set O3 level to 0
* Set flow to filter
* Set speaker to ON

__**TODO**__

* Add code for restoring cycle states
* Add code to ``Calibration Actor`` for storing cycle states
