## Calibration Continued  

I have added a backdoor to the sequence object that allows us to inject another object.  I will use this to supply the queue for the actor object.


The one issue is that when we have to rebuild the low level API, we then have to relink EVERYTHING!!!

The **O2 flow** uses the ``devID`` of O2.
