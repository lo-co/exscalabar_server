## More Attempts to Troubleshoot

So, did some work on another computer with the same results.  Seems this computer is not the issue.  Oe thin that I noted in my launch of nested actors was that I was not maintaining the flow of the ``Actor::Launch Nested Actor``, i.e. I had not connected the output so the nested actors were not showing in the ``Controller`` actor queues.  I fixed this on that other computer and imported it to my home.

Hallelujah!  The problem is either in one of the launches.  I will figure this out tomorrow.
