Still working on the calibration actor.  I should be ready to test the calibration actor today with most functionality for the O3 calibration in tact.  I am having to implement a more significant architectural change that will put the log and configuration objects into the ``ExNested Actor`` which all of the actors in this project inherit from.

## Gardening

I have done a ton of gardening in order to clean things up and make them a bit cleaner.

* Changed the parent of ``Controller`` to be ``ExNested Actor``.  
* Moved all of the initialization and destruction of the configuration and log sessions to the ``Ex Nested::Pre Init Launch`` and ``Ex Nested::Stop Core``.  In conjunction with this, the initialization of the log will occur in the ``Ex Nested::Pre Init Launch`` which requires the ``Config Data`` object to be initialized first.
* Removed methods and references to the ``Config Data`` and ``System Log`` objects from all of the children of ``Ex Nested``.
* Cleaned up the ``Controller::Launch Devices`` method so that we were looping over repetitive tasks rather than just breaking them all out.

The one element that will need extensive testing here is the cleaning up of the ``Controller::Launch Devices`` method.  I *don't believe* I broke something, but it is the trickiest.
