## Calibration Routine

Currently working on a calibration routine that can be reused for

* O3 calibrations
* Pressure calibrations (although I am not sure this will serve a purpose given the experience of NOAA)

The calibration routine is centered around the actor ``Calibration Actor`` found in the ``Calibration`` library.  This actor will 

* Fire on demand
* Read in an xml file containing the information for calibration supplied by the user
* Run the calibration sequence
* Log successful execution of steps
* Stop on demand or when sequence is complete

The xml file will be used to populate a class called ``SEQ``.  ``SEQ`` is both a child of the ``STEP`` class and composed of instances of this class (via a queue).  These steps generally will send messages to the ``Controller`` object which will in turn forward the messages as necessary.

**__TODO__**
* Add message to start calibration
* Add code to launch calibration from main actor
* Verify that the actor starts and stops as requested
* Verify that the stop is clean (i.e. the actor is removed from the registry)

### Parser

I have written a parser for the xml (or at least begun to write one).  The parser uses a regex to grab the tags and then a similar method for grabbing the data between the tags.  The parser works thus far, ignoring the first two lines which include the xml definition and the calibration routine definition (``<OZONE>``).  

**__TODO__**

* Generate the sequence from the parsed tags and values
