## Custom UI Elements

I have a set of custom UI elements that allow me to tweak the look and feel of the interface.  Thus far, this includes a sting control/indicator, numeric control/indicator and an indicating button.  Both the string and the numeric can be ``readonly``.  They also accept functions for handling events when the cursor leaves the box (``e.on('blur', function(){})``).  These functions take no arguments but we can use the ``arguments`` keyword to pass arguments into a function.  So, if we wish to provide an index and a value (such as frequency), we might have a call that looks like this:

```javascript
$scope.setRate = function(){
  doSomething1 = argument[0];
  doSomething2 = argument[1];
  ...
}
```

and then in the HTML we would have 

```html
<directive-name evnt-func = "setRate(i,f)"></directive>
``` 
```
