## More working with the calibration actors

I think that I am going to push my steps into packed project libraries and see how this turns out. 

So, I got this working and it is pretty cool.  The only big issue that I see is if the API is not well defined.  In this case, you have to go through all of the steps that you used to build the system again.  Need to make sure the API is well defined and that all is in place before really getting serious about deploying this.  The project has be come too large to ensure that the system will play nice.

Another question that I have is how this will work if we want to deploy the steps independently of the rest of the project?  I think the solution to this is to work in bite size pieces and then fold it into the main project as part of the whole deal.  I am going to place the ``Calibration Actor`` into a separate project and try and hack away at the individual issues that arise.  One is making sure that the damn thing is pulling in everything from the PPLs.

One thing that needs to be done is to test the calibration API via a simple test harness.  We will load bogus messages.  **A real weakness in this is that we still have to know what messages need to be loaded for the operation of the calibration.  MAYBE THIS IS NOT THE BEST APPROACH DUE TO THE DEPENDENCIES?**
