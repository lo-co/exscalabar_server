## Error at Close

The error that occurs on close is due to the ``MAP DVR``.  It seems the DVR has been deleted prior to the running of the ``Controller::Stop Core``.  The problem is, **I can't find where this is occurring.**  For now, this is not causing a problem, I will attack this when everything else is running a-ok.

## Calibration

So, I am going to go with a hardcoded calibration sequence builder (for now).  Quicker, but dirtier...
