## Rebuilding the System

So, the system just seems broken so I am going to go ahead and rebuild it.

System is currently (finally) building.  Hopefully all is well.  I still haven't tried to get this thing operational, but I suspect I shouldn't have any major issues.  I need to focus on now the calibration system.

**It appears that packed project libraries will not work!!** It seems to be too late in the game to start using them and attempting to pack a library containing a message is destructive (i.e. the build is too large).  I think  that I will just call them using the get default from path VI.
