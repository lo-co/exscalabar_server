# Attempts to deploy the server

I have made ennumerous attempts to get the server functional as an exe and what this is all coming down to seems to be that the system is trying to load files from two different locations.  One is from the main app and the other is from web services directories.  Even with the web services removed from the system, I am still getting these errors.  I have now removed web services references from the server - we will now see if the damn thing breaks....

Removing the web services from the server didn't do it, so now I am trying to remove the Network Actor stuff from the project... Didn't work.

Now trying to remove O3 Actor (``O3Lamp``).  This one was indicated in the debug.  Removing from ``Controller::Actor Core``.  Here it is simply launched via ``Launch Nested``.  Removed it from the ``Calibration`` library.  Removing ``Change Frequency MSG`` and ``Change O3 Lamp Run MSG`` from calibration library.

Removing ``Controller::Launch Devices``.

**TOTALLY MESSED UP OPERATIONAL SERVER!!!!**  That being said, I did get a good build with ALL of the above taken out and the *Additional Exclusions* in the pbuild spec's directive adjusted (basically everything checked except the bottom two).

Soooo....was able to build without starting the O3 actor.  Now trying to build with the web services.
