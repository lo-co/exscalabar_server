# The EXSCALABAR User Interface

The directory structure is intended to provide some insight into the architecture of the UI.  The architecture roughly follows some of the guidelines laid out by [John Pappa](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).  Each piece is wrapped in an [immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression) in an attempt not to pollute the global namespace with objects that don't need to be out there.  Each piece of code is intended to be small and focused.

## The Build System

All files are processed during editing using the [Gulp build tool](http://gulpjs.com/).  Gulp can be used to perform a variety of tasks, but it is here used to 

* lint
* concatenate
* minify
* uglify 
* 
In addition, Gulp provides a web server that allows live reload on change and watches and adjusts the generated files as changes occur.

During the build process, two files are produced and both are stored in the folder found in the main directory ``assets``.  The first file, ``exscalabar.js`` is the concatenated file.  This file can be used for development purposes and contains all of the files required by the system concatenated in the correct order (this list of files is defined in ``gulpfile.js`` under the variable ``watch_list``.

The developer may bypass the use of this tool entirely simply by placing the references to the individual scripts in the file ``index.html``.

## Overview

The application entry point (``index.html``) resides within the top-level directory along with some documentation and helper files.  The main application uses AngularJS to inject views into this portion of the application via [directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) and store and share data between views via [services](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services).  

There are two types of views within the application - a view that is shared across all portions of the UI (such as the sidebar and navigation bar) and views that provide functionality particular to an aspect of instrument operation (such as the PAS or CRDS control).  The former views and their respective controllers and services are stored within the folder ``app`` in the main directory.  The latter are stored in the folder ``views``.
