Why AngularJS?
------------------
It will make the most sense to break out the user interface using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).  The syntax for Angular seems more straight forward and readable to me.  Angular provides all the pieces the other MVC frameworks does and the use of [directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) provides modularization that I was concerned that I would not be able to get without the use of [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) which would add another layer of complexity in a system that is already too complex.
